# ðŸ§  Vitamin Detection Using Deep Learning
Welcome to our deep learning project focused on revolutionizing nutrition analysis through image recognition! This repository contains the implementation of a system that can detect the presence of Vitamins A, B, C, D, and E from images of food using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

I) Problem Statement:
- Traditional methods for determining vitamin content in foodâ€”such as lab testing and manual nutritional analysisâ€”are often time-consuming, expensive, and inaccessible to the general public. This poses a significant challenge for individuals trying to maintain a balanced and vitamin-rich diet.

II) Our Solution:
- We propose a deep learning-based approach that leverages image processing to classify food items by their vitamin content. By simply capturing an image of a meal, users can receive instant feedback on its vitamin composition, making nutritional tracking easy, accessible, and real-time.

III) Key Features:
- Detection of Vitamins A, B, C, D, and E using food images
- Built on VGG16, ResNet50, and a custom hybrid model (VitaminNet)
- Achieved up to 85.7% accuracy using the hybrid VGG16-ResNet50 architecture
- Real-time predictions with image input support
- Model trained using transfer learning and data augmentation
- Potential for mobile or web deployment

IV) Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

V) Model Architectures
1. VGG16
Transfer learning with ImageNet weights
Accuracy: ~84%

2. ResNet50
Transfer learning with residual connections
Accuracy: ~43% (not ideal on this dataset)

3. VitaminNet (Hybrid Model)
Combines feature maps from VGG16 and ResNet50
Accuracy: 85.7%

Lower test loss and better generalization

VI) Results Summary
- Model---------Test-Accuracy-------Test-Loss
- VGG16-----------84.0%--------------0.57
- ResNet50--------43.0%--------------0.95
- VitaminNet------85.7%--------------0.48

VII) Future Scope
- Expand dataset with more diverse food images
- Try other architectures like EfficientNet or Inception
- Real-time deployment on smartphones/web
- Add interpretability tools (e.g., Grad-CAM)
- Integrate with nutrition/diet recommendation systems
